= gh-run-watch

Waits for a GitHub Actions Workflow Run to finish and then *speaks out loud* whether it was successful (_“Build succeeded.”_) or not (_“Build failed! Attention, build failed!”_).

Useful when the CI can take some time and you are easily distracted.

== Prerequisites

* The `say` binary available in your PATH. (macOS has this by default.)
* Node.js installed.

== How to use

[source,sh]
----
gh run-watch https://github.com/user/repo/actions/runs/123456789
----

The above command will run `gh run watch --repo user/repo 123456789`, and you will see live updates in the terminal.

Once the command is finished, it will say out loud whether the build succeeded or failed.
