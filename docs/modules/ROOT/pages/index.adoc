= gh-run-watch

Waits for a GitHub Actions Workflow Run to finish and then *speaks out loud* whether it was successful or not.
Useful when the CI can take some time and you are easily distracted.

== Prerequisites

* The `say` binary available in your PATH. (macOS has this by default.)
* Node.js installed.

== How to use
